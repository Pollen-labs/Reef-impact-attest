Coral Action Attestation — EAS Schema (raw)

POC schema (already used in app):
string user

MVP schema v1 
# Recipient is always provided separately when calling attest/attestByDelegation

string regenType,
string[] regenLocation,
string regenDate,        # e.g. "MM-DD-YYYY" (human-readable)
uint256 depthScaled,       # meters x100 (e.g., 3.50m → 350)
uint256 surfaceAreaScaled, # m^2 x100 (e.g., 12.34 → 1234)
string[] species,          # multiple selections
string summary,
string[] contributors      # multiple contributors

Rationale and notes
- Arrays: species, contributors, and regenLocation are arrays (EAS supports primitive arrays like string[]).
- Location: regenLocation is [lat, lng] as strings for simplicity (e.g., ["25.0343","-77.3963"]).
- Date: stored as a human-readable string as requested. Consider ISO (YYYY-MM-DD) to avoid locale ambiguity.
- Numeric fields: EAS does not support decimals. Use scaled integers for depth and surface area (x100) so you keep two decimals.
- Recipient: not part of schema; passed in the attestation params separately.
